## Package Title
HEEL

## Location
Github

## Vignette(s)

## Application(s)
This package is a collection of functions that have been written by members of the Holtgrieve Ecosystem Ecology Lab for a variety of purposes.
Personally, I most frequently use the "EA.NACHO" functionality of the package, which takes raw stable isotope analysis data and finalizes that data by
comparing it with a known standard value.
