## Review
This package is a collection of functions that have been written by members of the Holtgrieve Ecosystem Ecology Lab that generally are all related to stable isotope data analysis. Personally, I most frequently use the "EA.NACHO" functionality of the package, which takes raw stable isotope analysis data and finalizes that data by comparing it with a known standard value. It also makes graphs to check the accuracy and precision of the mass spec and elemental analyzer and drift corrects the data. It outputs a PDF file that has lots of helpful information about the samples being analyzed. This package is easy to use and has lots of good documentation to help the user understand how to use it and what it is doing which I like. There is nothing specific that I wish it did differently, but it also took a few versions to get it working how it currently is. When I first started using this package it was still in development and so some of the functionality didn't work well yet. I would only reccommend this package to people also using the SAFS EA and mass spec because a lot of the functionality is specific to our system.
